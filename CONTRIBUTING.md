## :zap: Important Points to remember while submitting your work üìç 

We want your work to be readable by others; therefore, we encourage you to note the following:

- If To Do List is submitted for example, the Folder Name should be "To-Do-List" and also add a Screenshot of the project in the project folder with the named "To-Do-List.webp" as webp file has small size.
- Projects should be kept according to their technologies, as it will be easy to maintain the project and increase their readability.
- Strictly use Kebab-Case (hypen-separated) in your file-name, as it will be easy to parse in future using scripts.
- Please avoid creating new directories if at all possible. Try to fit your work into the existing directory structure you have created for your project. If you want to, please contact before doing so.
- The [README.md] file should be concise and clear about what the project is about and what it does. [***README TEMPLATE***](https://github.com/Avdhesh-Varshney/WebMasterLog/blob/main/.github/PROJECT-README-TEMPLATE.md)
- It should be documented briefly enough to let readers understand. 
- If you have modified/added code work, make sure that algorithm works before submitting.
- If you have modified/added documentation work, ensure your language is concise and contains no grammar errors.
- For front end designers, back end developers and UI/UX designers follow the project structure mentioned in below.
- Do not update the [README.md] and [CONTRIBUTING.md].

<h2 align="center">Note from Admin ‚ùó</h2>
<p align="center">While on one hand our repository is a good place for beginners to contribute something useful to open source, on the other hand it is also a good place for experienced people to contribute something useful to open source.</br></br>We welcome contributions from everyone. However some people tend to spam the repository with irrelevant pull requests and get one PR for open-source events. We do not want that to happen.</br></br>So we have a few guidelines that we would like you to follow. In case we find your PR not relevant or spam, we will mark it as invalid and it will not be counted towards any open-source programs.</p>
